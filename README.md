android_vendor_oppo_find5
=========================

These are all the vendor files found on the Oppo Find 5 update zip. They are not all utilized for building, they were merely copied via "cp -R". 

It appears this readme is necessary because some people mistakenly believe that they are all used when in reality, it's only because I'm lazy :)
